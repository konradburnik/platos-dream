## The Philosophy

> "In the realm of pure thought, where numbers dance and shapes reveal eternal truths, there exists a dream older than time itself."

Plato believed that mathematics exists in a perfect realm of forms - unchanging, eternal, waiting to be discovered. This game invites you to journey through that realm, meeting the greatest mathematical minds in history and glimpsing the eternal truths they uncovered.
